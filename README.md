# HMM_algorithms
Implementing algorithms for hidden Markov models for KTH Artificial Intelligence DD2380

## HMM1
Given the current state probability distribution, return the probabilities for the 
different emissions after the next transition.

## HMM2 - forward algorithm
Calculate the probability of observing a certain emission sequence given a hidden Markov model.

## HMM3 - Viterbi algorithm
Estimate the most likely sequence of states.

## HMM4 - Baum-Welch algorithm
Estimate parameters of a hidden Markov model given an emission sequence and initial guesses for lambda.
